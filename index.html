                <p>
                    Consumers are frustrated by long and uncertain wait times at restaurants and the lack of choice in
                    their dining experiences. Restaurant owners and staff are frustrated by conventional reservation
                    systems and uncertainty involving customer satisfaction. A more efficient solution for managing
                    customer preference and reservations should be available on the market.
